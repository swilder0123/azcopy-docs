## azcopy load

Sub-commands related to transferring data in specific formats

### Synopsis

Sub-commands related to transferring data in specific formats, such as Microsoft's Avere Cloud FileSystem (CLFS) format.

### Examples

```

Load an entire directory to a container with a SAS in CLFS format:
  - azcopy load clfs "/path/to/dir" "https://[account].blob.core.windows.net/[container]?[SAS]" --state-path="/path/to/state/path"

```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for load
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --cap-mbps float                      Caps the transfer rate, in megabits per second. Moment-by-moment throughput might vary slightly from the cap. If this option is set to zero, or it is omitted, the throughput isn't capped.
      --output-type string                  Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is 'text'. (default "text")
      --trusted-microsoft-suffixes string   Specifies additional domain suffixes where Azure Active Directory login tokens may be sent.  The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.
```
